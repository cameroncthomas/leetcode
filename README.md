# LeetCode Solutions

This repo contains my solutions to [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) problems I have solved in Python.

In my solutions, I briefly explain the optimal approach (and any other approaches if applicable) and then code it up. Time and space complexities are also provided.

In the table below, you will find the original LeetCode problem and my solution to it.
